## Progress Report Milestone
_List all the issues that your group should fix for each project and highlight the issues you have implemented/fixed so far. Explain the reason for choosing these issues. (Total: 10 point)_
Project | Issue Number Links    | Reason for Issue (Importance / Dependency) | Our Status | People assigned | Forked repository
--------|-------|-----|---|----|---
Joinery |[38](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/38) | This issue is important since it will allow the developer to control the execution of the program without running the program from starting the program again. This will improve the resiliency of the systems. | **In Progress** | Piyush, Mohit
Joinery | [51](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/51) | This issue is useful since it will improve the interability of the data. Data without identifiers would cause a major cause of functionality. This is especially useful for big data since searching wouldn't be possible without tagging. No Dependency as its a feature | **COMPLETED** |Ryan, Piyush | [Forked Repo](https://github.com/rfraser3/joinery)
Joinery |[63](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/63) | Make the date time format in an standardized manner will allow interoperability of Joinery with other applications. It will reduce time spent in standardizing Date & Time formatting for developers.  | **In Progress** | Ryan, Piyush 
Joinery |[75](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/75) | Index in general plays an important role in search and read operations and makes it efficient . Sorted Indexes are better and more efficient for such operations specially when you are dealing with Big Data. No Dependency as its a feature | **COMPLETED** | Piyush, Mohit | [Forked Repo](https://github.com/pkatre2/joinery)
Joinery |[83](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/83) | This issue is important since it allows data manipulation through integration of multiple dataframes. This extensibility improves the capabilities of the joinery project and allows it to perform more advanced operations such as analytics. | **COMPLETED** | Piyush, Mohit | [Forked Repo ](https://github.com/mmunjal/joinery)
Joinery | [93](https://github.com/cardillo/joinery/issues/93) | Writing to csv should be supported for multiple separators . Today Joinery only supports comma as a separator. Comma can be present in data as well which can cause the data quality issues for down stream apps . | **In Progress** | Eshia, Ryan
Alexa | [297](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java/issues/297) | Dependency version issue | To be started | TBA
Alexa |[225](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java/issues/225) | This is important because currently there is no way for SDK to indicate if object can or cannot be null, which results in a lot of excess defensive code written by user to check nullability of objects. | To be started | TBA
Alexa | [203](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-java/issues/203) | Alexa has an issue where it errors out when special characters associated with emojis when using ssml the alexa interface errors out and quits. It would be useful to have some sort of sanitizing function that would avoid erroring out. This feature can be useful for alexa skills that read tweets or online posts/comments. | No longer in development | Muaath, Eshia
Jbot | [28](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/28) | This issue is useful since it allows users to directly share files using bots to slack. This reduces work for users in highly critical and repeatable scenarios such as sharing standard healthcare protocols. | **COMPLETED** | Nilesh, Muaath | [Forked Repo](https://github.com/nilesh981/jbot/commit/fafe5033687d64bbc7b9581c3cf459d7ca533be2)
Jbot | [13](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/13) | |  To be started | TBA
Jbot | [172](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/172) | Supporting this feature in JBOT will allow users to read excel data by transmiting in XLS. This will allow the user to directly work on data, save time and improve the productivity of users. This feature will provide ease of use for users to interact with bot. By using excel as default way of sending data (since it is the most commonly used data application), the bot is able to broaden its user base. | **COMPLETED** | Nilesh | [Forked repo](https://github.com/nilesh981/jbot/commit/319558431aad8e46cda249f47fa0889106d8417d)
Jbot | [171](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/171) | Jbot is not able to close a coversation correctly through slack. The aim is to replicate the issue and attempt finding out where the bug may exist. | **In Progress** | Muaath, Eshia
Jbot | [166](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/166) | |  To be started | TBA
Jbot | [131](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/131) | |  To be started| TBA
Jbot | [197](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/197) | There is an issue with the scheduler it will confirm that a meeting is set even if the time is not valid. A validator for the bot should be created to avoid this problem. | **COMPLETED** | Muaath | [Forked Repo](https://github.com/Mistermo716/jbot/tree/add-time-validation)
Jbot | [114](https://github.com/rampatra/jbot/issues/114) | With Jbots current list of dependencies it cannot be built and tests fail. Changing the springboot dependency to 1.5.3.RELEASE resolved the issue. The dependency must be updated for future work on this open source project. | **COMPLETED** | Muaath | [Forked Repo](https://github.com/Mistermo716/jbot/tree/fix-springboot-dependencies)
